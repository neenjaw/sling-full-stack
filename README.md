# Sling

This is a project which will loosely follow [this blog/project/tutorial](https://medium.com/@benhansen/lets-build-a-slack-clone-with-elixir-phoenix-and-react-part-1-project-setup-3252ae780a1).

Some notable differences so far:
- Typescript, rather than Javascript
- Phoenix Framework 1.5+ rather than 1.3
- React Hooks, rather than React extends Component
- Styled-Components, rather than aphrodite
- Up to date `react-router-dom` rather than `react-router`

The goal is to have a back end server to run the chat app, and then a React Component which can then be run in an iframe at somepoint.
